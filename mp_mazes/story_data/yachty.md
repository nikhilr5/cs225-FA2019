Lil Yachty is on his way back to Atlanta from a bumping concert at 4 am when all of a sudden his car's engine exploded.  Yachty is alone and gets out of the car to see the issue.  He opened the hood to see the engine complete destroyed and knew he wasn't going to be able to fix it.  Yachty was still 40 miles away from his home and had no cell phone service.  He noticed an homeless man about 30 feet away sleeping in the alley.
